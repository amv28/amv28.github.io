<h1> The Sickness Unto Death </h1>
      <ol><li>"Every actual instant of despair is to be referred back to possibility."</li>

          <li>"Despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die."</li>

          <li>"What is intolerable to her is that she cannot get rid of herself."</li>

          <li>"If there were nothing eternal in a woman she could not despair."</li>
          <li> </li>

          <li class="small">"Even that which, humanly speaking, is the most beautiful and lovable thing of all,
            a feminine youthfulness which is sheer peace and harmony and joy - even that is despair."</li></ol></div>
